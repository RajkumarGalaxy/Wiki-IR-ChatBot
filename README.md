# Wiki-IR-ChatBot

### A ChatBot that can respond with humans by retrieving information directly from Wikipedia.
### User is open to choose any topic of interest!

### In this project?
> This project builds an information retrieval (IR) chatbot that can scrape Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup in the topic of user's interest and collect information against user's queries following a heuristic backed by TF-IDF score and cosine-similarity score. This Wiki-IR-ChatBot is user-friendly in permitting users to choose any topic and presenting either crisp and short response or detailed response. It leverages NLTK library to do text processing and scikit-learn library to do modeling. Let's dive deep!

#### This repository contains:

[`Wiki_IR_ChatBot.py`](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Wiki-IR-ChatBot/blob/main/Wiki_IR_ChatBot.py)  - A Python version of ChatBot

[`wiki-ir-chatbot_1.ipynb`](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Wiki-IR-ChatBot/blob/main/wiki-ir-chatbot_1.ipynb) - A Interactive Notebook version of ChatBot (Earlier versions also available)

[`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Wiki-IR-ChatBot/blob/main/requirements.txt)  - Explores Python libraries requirements to run the project

### What is a chatbot?
> A ChatBot is a kind of virtual assistant that can build conversations with human users! A Chatting Robot. Building a chatbot is one of the popular tasks in Natural Language Processing.

### What is Information Retrieval?
> Information Retrieval (or, IR in short) is the task of identifying and collecting the most relevant information from a source based on a pre-defined heuristic. Text data is a good example of unordered data while it is abudant everywhere. It is hard to find the information manually from a huge collection of text data. Since need of information is time-bound in general, a good IR system is always in need. 

### Are all chatbots the same?
> Chatbots fall under three common categories:
>##### 1. Rule-based chatbots
>##### 2. Retrieval-based chatbots
>##### 3. Intelligent chatbots
 
### Rule-based chatbots
> These bots respond to users' inputs based on certain pre-specified rules. For instance, these rules can be defined as if-elif-else statements. While writing rules for these chatbots, it is important to expect all possible user inputs, else the bot may fail to answer properly. Hence, rule-based chatbots do not possess any cognitive skills.

### Retrieval-based chatbots
> These bots respond to users' inputs by retrieving the most relevant information from the given text document. The most relevant information can be determined by Natural Language Processing with a scoring system such as cosine-similarity-score. Though these bots use NLP to do conversations, they lack cognitive skills to match a real human chatting companion. This [Wiki-IR-ChatBot](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Wiki-IR-ChatBot) falls under this category!

### Intelligent AI chatbots
> These bots respond to users' inputs after understanding the inputs, as humans do. These bots are trained with a Machine Learning Model on a large training dataset of human conversations. These bots are cognitive to match a human in conversing. Popular Virtual Assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri fall under this category. Further, most of these bots can make conversations based on the preceding chat texts. [Conversational AI ChatBot](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy/Conversational-AI-ChatBot), built by [Author](https://github.com/RajkumarGalaxy), employs Microsoft's DialoGPT to make intelligent conversations!
